# Arcate MCP Connect — Server

The official MCP server for [Arcate](https://arcate.io). Gives AI agents like Claude direct access to your product discovery workspace — reading signals, browsing your roadmap, and writing new feedback back in.

This is a **remote HTTP server** — no installation required. Configure a URL in your MCP client and connect instantly.

> **Requires an active Evidence subscription (€129/mo).** API keys are generated in `/settings/integrations` inside your Arcate workspace.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate an API Key
Log in → **Settings → Integrations → Generate API Key**. Copy the key — shown only once.

### 2. Configure your MCP client

**Claude Desktop** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
"arcate": {
      "serverUrl": "https://eshuikffwhaxcvkzaewj.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-server",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer [YOUR API KEY]"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

**Cursor** → Settings → MCP → Add Server → Type: HTTP → URL:
```
https://mcp.arcate.io
```
Header: `Authorization: Bearer arc_YOUR_KEY_HERE`

### 3. Restart your AI client and test
> "What are my top 5 unlinked customer signals from the last 30 days?"

## Security

- Keys are stored as SHA-256 hashes. The plaintext is shown only once and never stored.
- Every request is re-validated against `billing_status` and `use_mcp` capability.
- All queries are hard-scoped to your `organization_id`. Cross-tenant access is impossible.
- MCP-created signals are tagged with `ingestion_source: mcp` for audit filtering in the UI.

---

## Architecture

The server is deployed as a Supabase Edge Function implementing JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP (the MCP Streamable HTTP transport). A `GET` request to the server URL returns a human-readable info card — no MCP client needed to inspect it.

Source: `src/` — TypeScript reference implementation  
Deployment: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno)

## Database Setup

Apply the migration in `supabase/migrations/add_mcp_tables.sql` to bootstrap the `api_keys` table.
